# Tesla Fetch
Teslafetch is a command line tool written in go 1.22.5. Teslafetch can be used to view the status of your vehicle from the command line in a convient and aesthetically pleasing way. Soon, you will
also be able to send commands to your vehicle straight from your terminal.

The repo is split into two parts. One is the web server you can run locally to interact with the Tesla API. Two is the client app that will display and draw vehicle data to your terminal.

Teslafetch does not support any Model X or S released before 2018.
